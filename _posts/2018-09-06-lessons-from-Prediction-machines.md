## Lessons from the book "Prediction Machines" (authored by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb)
#### Date: June 11th, 2018

I am quite interested in the economics of the new industrial revolution. I have the lens of a person trained in the technicalities of machine learning and artificial intelligence (and a namesake minor in economics from my undergrad days). So my understanding of the effects of AI on the economy and how it might shape the world moving forward is extremely limited. In the past, I have watched a few YouTube/Netflix documentaries on how the industrial revolution via steam engines, the computer revolution, the internet revolution and most recently the cellphone revolution have changed the world and affected the way people live their lives. They were contemplative perspectives. And contemplation can sometimes lead to overfitting and cause-effect relationships misunderstood. So, a forward looking book is a good refresher for me. Here are a few things I learned so far:

- The current Artificial Intelligence revolution doesn't bring intelligence. It brings a critical component of itelligence namely prediction.
- Prediction is critical in many businesses and in people's lives. It is involved consciuosly or sub-consciously in any decision making process.
- Prediction is simply the process of filling in missing information by using the information we have (data), to generate information we do not have.

#### Cheap predictions means prediction everywhere
- 200 hundred years ago, when artificial light was beginning to be used, it was 400 times more expensive than it is today. It used to be used limitedly (perhaps in certain streets and rich households). But as it got cheaper, we see it being used everywhere and things rarely imagined before became commonplace (like large building that natural sunlight cannot penetrate, lit up by artificial light). 
- The computer revolution made arithmetic cheaper. Cheap arithmetic is now being used in applications not traditionally arithmetic in nature, like photography (remember the times of dark rooms and chemicals generating our photographs?).
- Recently predictions were used for traditionally prediction intensive tasks like inventory management and demand forecasting. Off late, they are being used to manage and search our digital photos (until recently, it used to be an arithmetic only domain). And in self driving cars!
- Cheap can change strategy: today Amazon uses the shop-then-ship strategy. If predictions become extremely good (in a hypothetical future), it might be cheaper for Amazon to use the ship-then-shop model: Amazon is so sure about individual customers' future consumption pattern, that it ships them the product first and consumers have the option to return it if they don't need it. This new business model can open up many new industries (like logistics for product returns) and can transform the business.
- When something becomes cheap, its complements become more valuable. For predictions they are things like data, judgement, action and realistic simulators.


#### Prediction: What is happening today?
- With the advent of machine learning (deep learning in particular for many applications), the cost of producing the same quality of prediction has dropped significantly. We can see this in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Speech Processing (for example). Seeing a computer vision model correctly classify tumors might seem magical. But they are just better predictions.
- In the 1990s, credit card companies caught abuot 80% of fraudulent transactions. In 2000s it was improved to 90-95% and is at 98 - 99.9% today. The last jump has been a result of machine learning. The jump looks small, but are extremely significant. An improvement from 85% to 90% means that mistakes reduce by a third. A jump from 98% to 99.9% means that mistakes fall by a factor of 20. This improvement means that credit card companies can detect and address fraud before a customer notices anything amiss. This is huge and transformational for both the company and the customer.

#### Intelligence and predictions
- Machine learning is different from statistics. Statictics cares about being right on an average. Machine Learning's goal is operational effictiveness (it can be slightly wrong all the time, yet be very useful in practice). Such an approach drove rapid improvements in the field by giving researchers the freedom to experiment. Machine learning uses many elements of statistics to be effective.
