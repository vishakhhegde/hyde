I was part of an exciting and transformative startup course at Stanford called [Hacking for Defence](https://australumina.wordpress.com). As a part of this course, we used principles from the Lean Launchpad methodology to solve specific National Security Issues. I got to learn a little bit about the US military industrial complex.
