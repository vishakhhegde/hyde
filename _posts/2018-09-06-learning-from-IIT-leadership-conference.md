IIT Bay Area Leadership conference is one of the largest professional IIT alumni meetups. It is a meeting place of technologists (mostly), VCs, CEOs, business leaders who meet up and exchange their professional and personal experiences with others. Here are a few things I learned in that conference (this is a personal note-keeping blog, but I hope it is useful)

#### Date: June 9th, 2018
#### Venue: Santa Clara Convention Center

### Keynote speech from Umang Gupta
1. Technology is a ticket to the game, but not the game itself: He spoke about his experiences starting companies like Gupta Technologies, and what he learned from that. People build lots of amazing technologies everywhere. However, in many cases, a distinguishing factor for startups competing in crowded domains is the business model and the go to market strategy. The reason being, as technologies get commoditized, it becomes harder to distinguish yourself based on technology alone. Example being early success of Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) in locking in customers and IBM (during the mainframe era).

2. Be aware of the fact that you will be disrupted tomorrow even if you are the disrupter today: Be open to new ideas and innovation happening around you, even if it means disrupting your current business. You’d rather disrupt your own business rather than let someone else do it.

3. Separate yourself from the company’s destiny: Your destiny is not your company’s destiny. You might go on to do a lot of other things in the future. Find meaning in something much bigger than your startup.

### Lessons about disruption:
1. In an era where things move super-fast and startups are short-lived, you need to constantly learn new things. Deliberately put yourself in roles that you are not fully qualified for.
Exploration versus exploitation: A classic machine learning dilemma happens in professional life as well. Learning to manage this can set you up for future success.

2. Consumer focussed innovation: Always listen to what the consumer says (even though you might not end up doing everything they ask you to do). Similar to lessons from Bezos.
Innovation and disruptions cannot be just on the technology front, but also on the business end. Consider how AirBnb is disrupting the hospitality market. Pay attention also to new business model disruptions.

3. Measure the percentage of revenue that you are destroying with innovation and disruption: Applies to large organizations looking to undergo a transformation.

### Lessons from Ravi Mhatre and Greg Schott:
1. It is very important to build the foundational elements of a company early on: like the culture of the company.

2. Hiring the one of the most underrated components of a leader. No one ever learns this in school. You are expected to wing it in the real world.

3. So, be intentional about hiring: get people who have similar long term thinking as you do. In the process of hiring, as questions or make them do things that are as close to their real future jobs as possible.

4. Have complementary interests and strengths on the board. Having like-minded people can create ego issues and unavoidable battles. Same applies for the founders.

5. Don’t be a pleaser CEO or a pleaser organization. You will end up building bloated softwares or might end up being a consultancy shop if you go after fulfilling all your customers’ requests. With right feature decisions, your customer will start to appreciate them over time.

### Other random learnings:
1. Measure your effectiveness. Metrics for something is the first step to improving them. This metric should ideally reflect how much stuff you got done, rather than time spent working on something.
