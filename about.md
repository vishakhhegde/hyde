title: About
---

I am a Machine Learning Scientist at Schlumberger [STIC](https://www.slb.com/about/rd/technology/stic.aspx) in Menlo Park, California. 
Previously, I graduated with a masters from [ICME, Stanford University](https://icme.stanford.edu) and also worked briefly at [Matroid Inc](https://www.matroid.com), a start-up working on computer vision. 
Over the course of two years at Stanford, I worked on various machine learning (ML) projects and took courses on Public Speaking and Entrepreneurship, among others. Prior to that, I earned my dual degree (BS and MS) in physics from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), where I worked on problems in quantum computing.

I am deeply interested in ML and its application in computer vision. I am also actively exploring promising tech-business ideas in the ML space.

I credit my "first-principles" thinking to my education in physics. 

My twitter handle is [@vishakhhegde](https://twitter.com/vishakhhegde), where I usually retweet exciting ideas and post updates on what I'm upto!
