title: About
---

I am a Machine Learning Scientist at Schlumberger Software Technology Innovation Centre in Menlo Park, California. Previously, I graduated with a masters from ICME, Stanford University and also worked briefly at Matroid Inc. Over the course of two years at Stanford, I worked on various machine learning (ML) projects and took courses on Public Speaking and Entrepreneurship, among others. Prior to that, I earned my dual degree (BS and MS) in physics from IIT Madras, where I worked on problems in quantum computing.

I am deeply interested in ML and its application in computer vision. I am also actively exploring promising tech-business ideas in the ML space.

I credit my "first-principles" thinking to my education in physics.
